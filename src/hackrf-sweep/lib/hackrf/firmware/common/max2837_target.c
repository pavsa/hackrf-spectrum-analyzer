	 * after a programmable delay using the on-chip PA bias DAC. The slow-
	 * charging Rx circuits are in a precharged “idle-off” state for fast
	 * Tx-to-Rx turnaround time.
	 *
	 * MAX2837_MODE_RX:
	 * All Rx circuit blocks are powered on and active. Antenna signal is
	 * applied; RF is downconverted, filtered, and buffered at Rx BB I and Q
	 * outputs. The slow- charging Tx circuits are in a precharged “idle-off”
	 * state for fast Rx-to-Tx turnaround time.
