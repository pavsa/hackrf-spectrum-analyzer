Enclosure Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The commercial version of HackRF One from Great Scott Gadgets ships with an injection molded plastic enclosure, but it is designed to fit two optional enclosures:

    * Hammond 1455J1201: HackRF One fits this extruded aluminum enclosure and other similar models from Hammond Manufacturing. In order to use the enclosure's end plates, you will have to drill them. An end plate template can be found in the HackRF One KiCad layout.

    * Acrylic sandwich: You can also use a laser cut acrylic enclosure with HackRF One. This is a good option for access to the expansion headers. A design can be found in the HackRF One hardware directory. Use any laser cutting service or purchase from a `reseller <http://greatscottgadgets.com/acrylic_case/>`__.
