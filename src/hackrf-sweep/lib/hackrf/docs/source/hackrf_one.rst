HackRF One
================================================

HackRF One is the current hardware platform for the HackRF project. It is a Software Defined Radio peripheral capable of transmission or reception of radio signals from 1 MHz to 6 GHz. Designed to enable test and development of modern and next generation radio technologies, HackRF One is an open source hardware platform that can be used as a USB peripheral or programmed for stand-alone operation.

    * open source



Using HackRF One's Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RESET button resets the microcontroller. This is a reboot that should result in a USB re-enumeration.

The DFU button invokes a USB DFU bootloader located in the microcontroller's ROM. This bootloader makes it possible to unbrick a HackRF One with damaged firmware because the ROM cannot be overwritten.

To invoke DFU mode: Press and hold the DFU button. While holding the DFU button, reset the HackRF One either by pressing and releasing the RESET button or by powering on the HackRF One. Release the DFU button.

The DFU button only invokes the bootloader during reset. This means that it can be used for other functions by custom firmware.



SMA, not RP-SMA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some connectors that appear to be SMA are actually RP-SMA. If you connect an RP-SMA antenna to HackRF One, it will seem to connect snugly but won't function at all because neither the male nor female side has a center pin. RP-SMA connectors are most common on 2.4 GHz antennas and are popular on Wi-Fi equipment. Adapters are available.



Transmit Power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HackRF One's absolute maximum TX power varies by operating frequency:

    * 1 MHz to 10 MHz: 5 dBm to 15 dBm, generally increasing as frequency increases (see this `blog post <https://greatscottgadgets.com/2015/05-15-hackrf-one-at-1-mhz/>`__)
    * 10 MHz to 2150 MHz: 5 dBm to 15 dBm, generally decreasing as frequency increases
    * 2150 MHz to 2750 MHz: 13 dBm to 15 dBm
    * 2750 MHz to 4000 MHz: 0 dBm to 5 dBm, decreasing as frequency increases
    * 4000 MHz to 6000 MHz: -10 dBm to 0 dBm, generally decreasing as frequency increases

Through most of the frequency range up to 4 GHz, the maximum TX power is between 0 and 10 dBm. The frequency range with best performance is 2150 MHz to 2750 MHz.

Overall, the output power is enough to perform over-the-air experiments at close range or to drive an external amplifier. If you connect an external amplifier, you should also use an external bandpass filter for your operating frequency.

Before you transmit, know your laws. HackRF One has not been tested for compliance with regulations governing transmission of radio signals. You are responsible for using your HackRF One legally.



Receive Power
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maximum RX power of HackRF One is -5 dBm. Exceeding -5 dBm can result in permanent damage!

In theory, HackRF One can safely accept up to 10 dBm with the front-end RX amplifier disabled. However, a simple software or user error could enable the amplifier, resulting in permanent damage. It is better to use an external attenuator than to risk damage.



External Clock Interface (CLKIN and CLKOUT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HackRF One produces a 10 MHz clock signal on CLKOUT. The signal is a 10 MHz square wave from 0 V to 3 V intended for a high impedance load.

The CLKIN port on HackRF One is a high impedance input that expects a 0 V to 3 V square wave at 10 MHz. Do not exceed 3.3 V or drop below 0 V on this input. Do not connect a clock signal at a frequency other than 10 MHz (unless you modify the firmware to support this). You may directly connect the CLKOUT port of one HackRF One to the CLKIN port of another HackRF One.

HackRF One uses CLKIN instead of the internal crystal when a clock signal is detected on CLKIN. The switch to or from CLKIN only happens when a transmit or receive operation begins.

To verify that a signal has been detected on CLKIN, use `hackrf_debug --si5351c -n 0 -r`. The expected output with a clock detected is `[ 0] -> 0x01`. The expected output with no clock detected is `[ 0] -> 0x51`.
